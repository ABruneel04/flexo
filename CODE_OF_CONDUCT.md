# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of Flexo pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language.**
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.**
- **Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.**
- **Focusing on what is best for the community.**
- **Showing empathy toward other community members.**

Examples of behavior that is not acceptable include:

- **Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.**
- **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal attacks.**
- **Sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.**
- **Posting or sharing private information without consent.**
- **Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate or unprofessional.**

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They may also ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (e.g., GitHub repositories, documentation, issue trackers, mailing lists, and chat channels) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness any form of harassment, discrimination, or other unacceptable behavior, please report it immediately by contacting the Flexo team at **[INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community members are expected to respect the decisions of those handling complaints.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may result in temporary or permanent bans from the Flexo community. Project maintainers will review all reports and take appropriate action in response. We appreciate the cooperation of all community members in helping us maintain a safe and welcoming environment.
