## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) to certify that contributions are properly licensed. To sign your commits with a DCO, simply add a line with your real name and email:

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

The easiest way to add this signature is using the `-s` flag when committing:

    git commit -s -m "Your commit message"

Your signature certifies that you agree with the DCO.
